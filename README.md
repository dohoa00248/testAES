# AES File Encryption Tool (Java)

A desktop application for encrypting and decrypting files using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm.  
The GUI is designed with Java Swing, allowing users to easily select files, set encryption keys, and perform secure file encryption/decryption.

> ⚠ Note: AES encryption logic was integrated by referencing open-source code from GitHub. This project focuses on interface design, integration, and user experience.
